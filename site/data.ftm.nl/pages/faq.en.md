### How up-to-date is the data?

This varies from dataset to dataset. While some sources are static, we run multiple scrapers to update official datasets on a weekly or monthly basis. Datasets that are updated automatically will show the update frequency in the dataset description.

### Can I add my own data to Aleph?

If you are granted access to Aleph as a journalist, youâ€™re welcome to upload documents, or to create an investigation with your persons of interest. Aleph helps you to systematize your own research, share it with colleagues and cross-reference lists of people with our archive. You can also use Aleph as an text recognition (OCR) tool for scanned documents. 

The data you upload will be visible to some members of FTM's data team, but no other editorial staff. 

### Can I ask for a dataset to be scraped and added to Aleph?

We welcome suggestions for scrapers that should be added to Aleph. We prioritize resources that would help our reporters with current investigations or investigations that are planned in the near future. In particular, we prioritize databases of beneficial ownership of companies, real estate, and financial payments by governments to the private sector.

Please reach out to the [FTM data team](data@ftm.nl) to suggest a dataset.

### Where do I start?

It depends on your case, but usually start with an investigation. In an investigation you can:

1. Upload your own documents. You can use a folder structure, just like on your computer. If you have many documents, please reach out to the data team, because we can do bulk uploads. 

2. Upload excel or csv files and create entities. Aleph works with entities like 'companies', 'people', 'projects', 'licenses'. But also relationships are entities, so for instance, 'people' can own 'companies', in which case you have an entity 'ownership'. The power of Aleph lies in these connections between things. It's possible to generate these connections in Aleph from an excel or csv file. If the documentation is not clear, please reach out to the data team.

3. Create a network diagram. This feature is really powerful. Basically you can build your investigation from the bottom up by creating entities and relationships. For instance, you start out with 'Company A'. When you create this entity, you can add all kinds of properties, like name, jurisdiction, creation data, dissolution date, links to sources, and many many things more. Next, you can create an entity 'Person', who maybe is a director. Finally you can create a link between the person and the company, e.g. a directorship and give that properties as well, for instance, start date, end date, a URL to a source. These diagrams make visual exploration possible, but also structures your data, so you can export it or compare it with other data in Aleph.

4. Cross-reference: if you have your own data in Aleph, you can cross-reference them with other datasets in Aleph and find new information and connections.
